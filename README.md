## Research on Web Integration

This folder (`Research`) contains various materials related to the integration of applications in web environments. The documents are written in **Spanish**.

- **Client Secrets:** Some examples in this research required client secrets for testing purposes. All sensitive information has been removed or replaced with placeholders.
- **Configuration Files:** Any configuration involving sensitive data (such as API keys or client secrets) should be filled using environment variables. Follow the setup instructions in each project folder for further details.

**Important:** Never upload real client secrets or credentials to public repositories. Use `.env` files or secure vaults for handling sensitive information in a production environment.
